## Overview

**What's for Dinner?** is an app that assists users in choosing recipes to build meals. The user can pick from randomized dishes in various categories, or they can input their own recipes.

#### Goals

- To match the provided comp by writing HTML and CSS and making that functional via JavaScript (JS)
- To better understand the concepts learned recently such as flexbox, data model vs. DOM, and user events
- To produce a functional, clean result as a result of individualized, solo work

#### Project Specs

## Reflections

I enjoyed this project! It gave us a chance to take what we've been learning in class and then apply our individualized skillset and visions to it. It was a little hard going from the pair project where you had someone to rely on to catch errors or suggest different ways of doing thing to having to be responsible for all those things on your own. Still, this was a great growing experience. I was very proud to have my app mostly match the comp and be functional. While I did not have time to attempt it, I am definitely interested in CSS and would have enjoyed delving deeper into the "Intermediate CSS" *Choose Your Own Adventure*.
